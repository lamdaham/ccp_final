                    <p class="card-caption">Bacon Q. Dog is a 9-year-old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.
                    At night, just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He places his toys on a mini couch and frantically drags the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                    Brul loves walks on the beach and taking sun naps on a warm summer day. Brul is a playful cat but enjoys having slow, relaxed days at the same time. She hates grooming and bathing.</p>

                    <p class="card-caption">Fitz loves chasing tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in winter, and in sun patches when available. He's energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap for too long.
                    He enjoys barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesnâ€™t get a snack.</p>
